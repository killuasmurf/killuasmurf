## Hi there 👋

I'm a Business Analytics undergraduate at NUS with strong interests in  
**Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Data Engineering, and Applied AI**.

I enjoy building end-to-end systems — from messy real-world data, to models for usable products.

## 🔍 What I work on
- Computer Vision (CNNs, image-based prediction, deployment)
- Machine Learning & AI (imbalance handling, (classification, ensembles, LLM prompting)
- Data Engineering (ETL pipelines, cloud workflows)
- Applied Analytics (dashboards, business insights)
